    <h1>The Story of the book</h1>
    <h2>chapter 1</h2>
    <p>molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. on her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature,</i><i>New Scientist,</i> and all other scientific journals her work had appreared in, was a well thumped copy of <cite>On The Road.</cite> It had been molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls more she felt she needed to be free. </p>
    <p>
        she had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an oscar wilde quote proclaming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do.</q> Alqthough many consider her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the Ilama <abbr title="dihan ne ali">DNA,</abbr> to be an outstanding acheivement, molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
